 <title>WebSocket Client</title>
 <shortdesc>The WebSocket Client origin reads data from a WebSocket server endpoint. Use the origin
        to read data from a WebSocket resource URL. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>WebSocket Client
                    origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>origins<indexterm>WebSocket
                    Client</indexterm></indexterm>When the pipeline starts, the WebSocket Client
            origin opens a connection to the WebSocket server endpoint. The WebSocket server pushes
            data to the WebSocket Client origin. The origin creates and sends a batch as soon as the
            data arrives. The size of each batch varies, based on the size of the data sent by the
            server endpoint. When the pipeline stops, the origin closes the connection to the
            endpoint.</p>
        <p>When you configure the WebSocket Client origin, you define the resource URL and headers
            to use for the requests. You configure whether the origin uses no authentication or
            basic authentication to connect to the WebSocket server endpoint. <ph
