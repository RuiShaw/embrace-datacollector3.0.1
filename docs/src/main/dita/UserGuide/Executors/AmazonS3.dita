            for the specified content or adds tags to an existing object each time it receives an
            event.</p>
        <p>Use the Amazon S3 executor as part of an event stream. <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph-S3usage"
            /></p>
        <p>When you configure the Amazon S3 executor, you specify the connection information, such
            as access keys, region, and bucket. You configure the expression that represents the
            object name and location. When creating new objects, you specify the content to place in
            the objects. When adding tags to an existing object, you specify the tags that you want
            to use.</p>
        <p>You can optionally use an HTTP proxy to connect to Amazon S3.</p>
