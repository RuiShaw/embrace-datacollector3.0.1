 <title>Changing Metadata</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>HDFS File Metadata executor<indexterm>changing
                metadata</indexterm></indexterm>You can configure the HDFS File Metadata executor to
            change metadata for a file in HDFS or a local file system after receiving an event. For
            example, you might use the executor to change file permissions after a destination
            closes a file.</p>
        <p>When changing file metadata, the HDFS File Metadata executor can change the following
            file metadata at the same time:<ul id="ul_gym_xw3_rx">
                <li>File name</li>
                <li>File location</li>
                <li>File owner and group</li>
                <li>File permissions</li>
                <li>Access control lists (ACLs)</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>When changing metadata, the user who impersonates the HDFS user must have the necessary
            permissions to perform the task. For more information about the HDFS user, see <xref
                href="HDFSFileMeta-HDFSUser.dita#concept_krb_g2f_pz"/>.</p>
