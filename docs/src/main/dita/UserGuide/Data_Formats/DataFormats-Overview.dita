 <title>Data Formats Overview</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>data formats<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Data formats - such as
            Avro, JSON, and log - are methods to encode data that adhere to generally accepted
            specifications.</p>
        <p>The way that stages process data can be similar based on the stage type and the type of
            data being processed. For example, file-based origins such as Directory and SFTP/FTP
            Client will typically process data formats the same way. Similarly, message-based
            destinations such as Kafka Producer and JMS Producer generally process data formats the
            same way. </p>
        <p>The documentation for each stage has a "Data Formats" section of documentation that
            contains processing details. </p>
        <p>This chapter includes the details that are too complex to summarize in the Data Formats
            sections. If you have browsed and discovered this chapter and want to read on, feel
            free. But for stage-related details, see the stage documentation. </p>
        <p>For information on the different data formats supported by each origin and destination,
            see <xref href="../Apx-DataFormats/DataFormat_Overview.dita#concept_bcw_qzb_kv"/>.</p>
