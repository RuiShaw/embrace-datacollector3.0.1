            creates an error record, it preserves the data and attributes from the record that
            triggered the error, and then adds error related information as record header
            attributes. For a list of the error header attributes and other internal header
            attributes associated with a record, see <xref
                href="InternalAttributes.dita#concept_itf_55z_dz"/>.</p>
        <p>When you configure a pipeline, you can specify the version of the record that you want to
            use: <ul id="ul_yqq_dvf_n1b">
                <li>The original record - The record as originally generated by the origin. Use this
                    record when you want the original record without any additional pipeline
                    processing. </li>
                <li>The current record - The record in the stage that generated the error. Depending
                    on the type of error that occurred, this record can be unprocessed or partially
                    processed by the error-generating stage. <p>Use this record when you want to
                        preserve any processing that the pipeline completed before the record caused
                        an error.</p></li>
