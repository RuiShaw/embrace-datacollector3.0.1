                    Producer</indexterm></indexterm>The JMS Producer destination writes data to a
            Java Messaging Service (JMS). Before you use JMS Producer, install the drivers required
            for your JMS implementation. </p>
        <p>When you configure a JMS Producer, you configure the connection information and the JMS
            destination name. You can optionally specify the JMS destination type, JMS credentials,
            and configure any additional JMS configuration properties that you require. </p>
        <note>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an alternative standard to JMS and any
            AMQP provider should also support JMS.</note>
